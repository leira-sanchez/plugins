description: Spawn three parallel review subagents over the active transcript, surface learnings, and route each to a concrete edit on an existing skill. Use when the user says reflect.

# Reflect

Read the [Codex runtime contract](../poteto-mode/references/codex-runtime.md) before executing this workflow.

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

## When to invoke

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "$pstack:reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## Process

### 1. Locate the active transcript

Use the current conversation or an explicitly supplied, workspace-verified transcript per the runtime contract. Inspect the actual format before parsing it. If the host does not expose history, write a concise digest of this session and give that to the reviewers. Do not search global session storage.

### 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

Launch three independent reviewers within the session's concurrency limit, with read-only briefs. Confirm required context tools are available; otherwise relay parent-fetched evidence. Resolve model preferences through the runtime contract.

| Lens | Role line | Default `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `inherit-parent` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect tooling` | `inherit-parent` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `inherit-parent` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the subagent result.

### 3. Synthesize

Spawn one synthesizer using the `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` preference, defaulting to inheritance. Give it a read-only brief and the evidence needed for citation checks. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

### 4. Structural enforcement check

Sanity-check the synthesizer's Accepted list. For any item that would be enforced more reliably by a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check, move it from Accepted to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

### 5. Apply

Before applying any Accepted edit, present the synthesizer's full Accepted/Rejected/Backlog output to the user and wait for explicit approval. The user picks which subset to apply and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

Keep backlog items in the report unless the user has authorized filing them in an external tracker.

For each approved Accepted item, follow the Routing field exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): use Codex’s `skill-creator` skill to revise and validate the workflow.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): use `skill-creator` to tighten the trigger and check it against representative requests.
- `new skill via skill-creator: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to `skill-creator`. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done. Skip this step if it doesn't.

### 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
